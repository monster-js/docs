# What is MonsterJS

MonsterJS is a JavaScript framework for building web applications or standalone components based on web components, which are suitable for encapsulating components and creating micro front-end apps.

This framework does not use virtual DOM; instead, it creates a watcher for each binding and updates it only when necessary. This feature is what makes it fast and gives it good client runtime performance and memory efficiency, even for large applications.

Official documentation [https://monster-js.org](https://monster-js.org).

## MonsterJS in Other Frameworks


MonsterJS works perfectly with other frameworks. Its components are all web components, making it easy to integrate with Angular, Vue, React, and other JavaScript frameworks. Additionally, it can be used in vanilla JavaScript applications.

This framework makes it easy to develop widgets, standalone components, and micro front-end architectures.
