# What is MonsterJS Cli

The MonsterJS CLI is an efficient and user-friendly command-line interface tool that is designed to simplify the process of creating new projects and generating MonsterJS files such as components, services, and more. Although it is not mandatory to use the CLI when building MonsterJS applications, utilizing this tool can offer great advantages to developers.

One of the key advantages of using the MonsterJS CLI is its ability to automate repetitive tasks, which saves a considerable amount of time and effort. With just a few simple commands, developers can create a new project or generate MonsterJS files without having to manually create and configure each file. This allows developers to focus on more important aspects of the application development process, such as writing code, debugging, and testing.
